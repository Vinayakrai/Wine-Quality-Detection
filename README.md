# Wine Quality Detection

**Wine Quality Detection** is a machine learning project that predicts the quality of wine based on physicochemical features. This project uses the Wine Quality dataset and demonstrates classification using various ML models.

## 🍷 Features

- Predicts wine quality on a scale based on chemical attributes.
- Compares models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
- Data preprocessing, feature scaling, and evaluation included.
- Visualization of model performance.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **Required Libraries**:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vinayakrai/Wine-Quality-Detection.git
cd Wine-Quality-Detection
```

2. **Run the Notebook**:

Use Jupyter Notebook or VSCode to open:

```bash
wine_quality_detection.ipynb
```

## 🚀 Usage

- Load the dataset (`winequality-red.csv` or `winequality-white.csv`).
- Preprocess and clean data.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models.
- View predictions and accuracy metrics.
